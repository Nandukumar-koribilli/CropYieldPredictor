# CropYieldPredictor

## Overview
CropYieldPredictor is a machine learning project designed to predict crop yields based on various agricultural parameters such as soil quality, weather conditions, and farming practices.

## Features
- Predicts crop yield using historical data
- Supports multiple machine learning models
- Data preprocessing and visualization tools
- User-friendly interface for inputting parameters

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Nandukumar-koribilli/CropYieldPredictor.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd CropYieldPredictor
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Prepare your dataset in CSV format with relevant features (e.g., soil nutrients, rainfall, temperature).
2. Run the main script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
3. Follow the prompts to input data or use the default dataset.
4. View predictions and visualizations in the output folder.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn

## Project Structure
- `data/`: Contains sample datasets
- `models/`: Trained machine learning models
- `src/`: Source code for preprocessing, training, and prediction
- `main.py`: Entry point for running the application
